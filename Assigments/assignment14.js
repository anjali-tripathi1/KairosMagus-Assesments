// Assignment14:Create an array containing 4 population values of 4 countries of your choice. You may use the values you have been using previously. Store this array into a variable called populations.

// Log to the console whether the array has 4 elements or not (true or false).

// Create an array called percentages containing the percentages of the world population for these 4 population values. Use the function percentageOfWorld1 that you created earlier to compute the 4 percentageÂ values.
